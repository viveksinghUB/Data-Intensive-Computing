##Algorithms and Models for Data Analysis, Learning and Prediction.

Implementations:


Implementation of linear regression, K-NN and K-means, which algorithm to use and why and when.
Examined the variables (features) of a problem, goodness of a model fit, metrics for evaluation of errors, outliers, scaling, and choosing appropriate data ranges for the computation.
Choose the parameters for prediction based on experimentation (repeated trials) and acceptable values of error rates.
Documented the experimentation process and the rationale.
Plot the outcomes for easy visualization of data analysis.
Interpret the results to enable decision making.
